🔐 I'm a passionate learner in the field of **ethical hacking**, **network security**, and **threat detection**. I love diving deep into systems to understand how they work, how they break — and most importantly, how to defend them. Whether it's scripting in Python or analyzing packets in Wireshark, I’m constantly sharpening my skills in the world of cybersecurity.
